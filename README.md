# Pensionate
A simulation of booking rooms in a pensionate, where the program ask the users a few inputs and alocates some students in specific rooms.
The original exercise was simple and direct and i thought it wasnt good enough, so i added a check to see if the room is occupied and if the entry is valid i also added a loop to add more students up untill
the building is full.

Will comeback later to update the program to save the state of the rooms in a separate file and to be more logical about the decisions of the user.
